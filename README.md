# Recursive Learning
Recursive Learning aims to eliminate the fear of entry-level students who want to learn recursion as it’s considered hard topic among all programming concepts</br>
  - through **Simulations** to make students capable to learn</br>
    - It will facilitate student to discover intermediate steps to grasp concept</br>
  - through **Visualization of memory blocks** in iterative manner to understand background processing of Recursive code</br>
    - Student can iterate their code line by line to witness code and memory coherence in order to execute relevant instruction</br>
    - It is to aid student’s mental model with corresponding visualization to enhance intermediate processing for effective learning</br> 
  - through **Converting iterative codes to recursive codes** to stimulate applied knowledge of recursive concepts</br>
 Given iterative codes are converted to corresponding recursive code</br>
  - through **Quizzes/Practice exercises** to test student learning</br>
